# UniPI-ActivityTracker
JavaFX2 application developed as part of the Java Programming course at University of Pisa. The goal is to provide an interface for users to track their work habits and to let the professor monitor them in a user-friendly way.

# Development
The development of the application had to follow the rules of software analysis, project and design. Because of this, the /doc folder contains a file (in Italian) which reports all the steps followed during development.

# Technologies used
- Java 8 with JavaFX2
- XML serialization and validation with XStream
- Client-server interaction for log purposes
- Local caching
- MySQL and Java Beans for interaction with database
